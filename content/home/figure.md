subtitle: The goal of the Climate Intervention Biology Working Group is to study the potential ecological impacts and risks of solar geoengineering, and provide information on those impacts and risks. This working group does not endorse or advocate either testing or actual implementation of geoengineering.

Projected surface temperature change in 2081-2100 in a scenario without mitigation compared with one where emissions are reduced (left) and in a scenario without mitigation, but with stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI) (right). Although SAI may cool the planet down to a certain global temperature target, the local cooling may be uneven, and there are potentially large impacts on ecosystems  (right).
