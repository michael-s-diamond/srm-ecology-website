Climate change and associated global warming is caused by humans (IPCC 2013). The solution is to stop greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating dependence on fossil fuels (IPCC 2013, 2014). 

Geoengineering, also known as climate intervention, is a set of proposed activities deliberately designed to counter the impacts of environmental change resulting from global warming. Geoengineering is under consideration as a temporary strategy that may help forestall the worst impacts of climate change as emissions reductions occur. It has received increasing attention in the face of failure to limit the inputs of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere (NASEM 2021). However, geoengineering alone will not remove all the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and should not be considered a solution. Emissions must stop for Earth’s temperature to stay within 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

Geoengineering is highly controversial. Nevertheless, many schemes for geoengineering have been proposed: these are usually divided between activities aimed at reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR) and activities aimed at partially reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation at the surface by increasing the albedo (reflectivity) of the Earth-atmosphere system in order to temporarily cool the planet (Solar Radiation Modification, SRM). Reducing Earth’s temperature with SRM could involve injecting sulfate precursors in the stratosphere (like volcanoes do) or increasing the condensation nuclei in the marine boundary layer (like ship tracks do). This geoengineering option presents both known and unknown risks to the natural living world. Yet almost nothing is known about the potential impacts of implementation, continuation, or termination on natural systems, their functions, and their biodiversity. 

Some climate intervention schemes have been extensively studied using complex Earth System Models. Earth System Models have their own uncertainty, and they are often run at spatial and temporal resolutions too coarse to align with most ecological systems. As a result, there is high uncertainty about the potential impacts of geoengineering.

The goal of the Climate Intervention Biology Working Group is to identify knowledge gaps and develop a research agenda to understand and predict the impacts and risks to biodiversity and functioning of natural systems, if solar radiation modification occurs in the future. Members will provide information to inform policy and public discussion, provide knowledge to incorporate into teaching and outreach, and engage a diverse audience in discussions on the response of living systems to solar radiation modification geoengineering.
