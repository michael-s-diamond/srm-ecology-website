Brendan Clark is a graduate research assistant at Rutgers University working with Dr. Alan Robock and Dr. Lili Xia in the Rutgers Impact Studies of Climate Intervention (RISCI) lab. He is generally interested in the potential impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) climate intervention on humans and the environment. His current research involves using Earth system models to investigate the impacts of SAI on global crop production.
