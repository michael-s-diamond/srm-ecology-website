Dr. Simone Tilmes is a Project Scientist II at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the liaison for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) chemistry-climate working group. Her scientific interests cover the understanding and evaluation of chemical, aerosol and dynamical processes in chemistry-climate models. She has investigated past, present and future evolution of the ozone hole in both hemispheres based on models and observations. Her recent work also focuses on tropospheric chemistry, aerosols, air quality, long-range transport of pollutants, and of tropospheric ozone. She further studies the impact of geoengineering on the Earth’s climate system, the hydrological cycle, and the impact of solar radiation management on dynamics and chemistry in both troposphere and stratosphere.
